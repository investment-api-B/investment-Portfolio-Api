# Investment-Portfolio API

The **Investment-Portfolio API** is a backend application designed to help users manage their investment portfolios. The API provides functionality for users to track stocks, manage their investments, check inflation rates, and handle payments securely. This service integrates with various financial data sources, such as Stripe for payments, to ensure accurate and secure portfolio management.

## Technologies and Tools

This project utilizes a variety of modern tools to build a scalable and secure API:

- **Spring Boot 3.3.3** - Simplifies the creation of Java-based web applications with minimal configuration.
- **Spring Security** - Implements authentication and authorization for secure access.
- **Spring Data JPA** - Manages data persistence with the Java Persistence API.
- **Swagger (Springdoc OpenAPI)** - Automatically generates API documentation.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)** - Handles authentication with stateless JWT tokens.
- **MapStruct** - Simplifies mapping between DTOs and entities.
- **Liquibase** - Provides version control for the database schema.
- **Testcontainers** - Facilitates integration testing using Docker containers.
- **H2 Database** - In-memory database for testing purposes.
- **MySQL** - Production-grade database for persistence.
- **Lombok** - Reduces boilerplate code through annotations.
- **Stripe** - Facilitates payment processing.
- **SerpApi** - Used for integrating with Google Search to retrieve search results.
- **Checkstyle** - Ensures code quality by adhering to coding standards.

## Architecture Overview

The application is designed with modular controllers that handle different business functions, including user management, portfolio handling, inflation data, and payments.
